        <h1>Project 15 - Introspective</h1>
        <div class="a"><p>There is quite a bit of new information that I learned this semester while taking COP4813. 
            I was nervous at first taking the class since I did not have an easy time when I had worked with JavaScript previously, 
            but I was pleasantly suprised by how the class was laid out and what was asked of the assignments. There
            were many great supporting links Dr. Eaglin provided, and the assignment goals were not hard to reach with 
            just a bit of research.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have worked with JavaScript previously, but during this class I felt that I truly learned about the 
            language and how to manipulate it. I also learned about the full capability of HTML, especially when it is paired 
            with CSS. I learned a lot about what goes into a website, as well as what makes a website good. I never
            really thought about mobile friendly designs and effective meta information before having to work on my own 
            website. Having to buy a domain and then finding hosting was also a new process for me. Getting your data from an 
            editor to a site was a longer process than I though it would be.
            <br>
            <br>
            This class really helped me to tune in to my more creative side. I really don't get to be creative with many 
            school assignments, so it was nice being able to have creative freedom over a project. I also got to learn a 
            lot more about Dr. Eaglin through working on a website for him. He one of the most interesting people that I have 
            talked to and learned about. He has done a lot of great things and is still looking to do more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before this class, I was set in wanting to go into cybersecurity, but now web development is another option that 
            I am sincerely considering. I regret not taking more web development classes before I graduate this year. For any 
            job as a web developer, heavy knowledge in the JavaScript, HTML, XML, jQuery, and CSS is a must. Knowing about UX and UI 
            is a requirement as well. Knowing how to work with server and back-end development tools is also required. These can 
            include ASP.NET, SQL Server, and MySQL. I have only done front-end development, so there is a lot more learning 
            I need to do if I do want to become a web developer.
